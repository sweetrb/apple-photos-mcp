# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-23
### Added
- **All tools now declare an MCP `outputSchema`.** Every tool migrated from `server.tool(...)` to `server.registerTool(...)` so its structured-output shape is advertised in the tool metadata and validated by the SDK. Schemas are intentionally permissive (all fields optional, no `.strict()`, loose element types for arrays) so they can describe the output contract without ever rejecting a valid result. No tool names, inputs, descriptions, or handler behavior changed.

### Changed
- **Rewrote the Hermes Agent packaging to match NousResearch's real spec.** `.hermes-plugin/` previously shipped Claude-format JSON (`plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` / `mcp.json`) that Hermes never reads; it now provides a `config.yaml` (a `~/.hermes/config.yaml` `mcp_servers:` snippet) plus a README with the `hermes mcp add` command. The README "Other Hosts" section is corrected to match (Hermes has no plugin/marketplace drop-in; Antigravity uses its native `mcp_config.json`). Claude Code, Codex, and Antigravity packaging are unchanged.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-23

First stable release. The public tool API (query / get-photo / library-info / list-* / export — all read-only except `export`) is now committed under semver 1.0. This release consolidates the recent multi-host packaging + marketplace work and adds production hardening.

### Added
- **Structured MCP tool descriptions on all 10 tools** in the `Use when: / Returns: / Do not use when:` shape (with a `Safety:` clause on `export`), so an agent can pick the right tool from metadata alone — matching the other Apple MCP servers.
- **CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md.**

### Changed
- **Switched to the manual-bump release model** (`publish.yml`, replacing the auto-bump `auto-release.yml`): the version is now bumped in the release commit, so `main`'s HEAD is always a normal CI-checked commit. This fixes the repo's perpetual non-green status (the old model's bot-pushed `chore(release)` commit never ran CI) and restores a per-release CHANGELOG.
- **Bumped `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to ^1.29.0**, clearing all `npm audit` advisories (transitive, from the SDK's unused HTTP transport) — `npm audit --omit=dev` is now clean.
- **Pinned the Python dependency range** (`osxphotos>=0.69.0,<0.76`) so an incompatible future minor can't silently change the output contract.

### Fixed
- **Permission errors are now actionable.** When osxphotos hits a Full-Disk-Access / "unable to open database" failure, every tool appends guidance (grant Full Disk Access; run the `doctor` tool; see `docs/FULL-DISK-ACCESS.md`) instead of surfacing the raw low-level error.
- **Python version is gated.** `scripts/setup.sh` now prefers a Python ≥ 3.11 interpreter and fails fast with guidance if only an older one (e.g. macOS's stock 3.9) is found. README updated to **Python 3.11+** (osxphotos needs ≥ 3.10; the date filters need 3.11).
- **Release reliability:** the `npm install -g npm@latest` step in `publish.yml` now retries, so a transient registry `ECONNRESET` no longer aborts a release.
- **Codex marketplace shipped the Apple Notes icon for Apple Photos.** Replaced `codex/assets/icon.png` (and added an `icon.svg` source) with a Photos-specific icon — a teal card with a mountains-and-sun glyph, part of a consistent Apple MCP icon family. (Same root cause as the Mail #56 / Numbers #7 reports.)

### Documentation
- README: added npm-downloads, supported-Node, platform-macOS, and MCP badges next to the existing version/CI/License badges.
- Documented the `doctor` tool in the Apple Photos skill tool table (it was registered but missing from the skill); kept the canonical and Codex skill copies in sync.

### Added

- **Multi-host plugin packaging (Codex, Hermes, Antigravity).** In addition to the existing Claude Code plugin, the repo now ships plugin manifests for three more hosts: a full **Codex** package (`codex/` with `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, bundled Apple Photos skill, and marketplace assets) plus `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; **Hermes** packaging (`.hermes-plugin/`); and **Antigravity** packaging (`.antigravity-plugin/`, with the bundled skill). Every host registers the same `apple-photos` MCP server (launched via `npx -y apple-photos-mcp`) and ships the same skill, so behavior matches the Claude Code plugin. `scripts/sync-plugin-version.mjs` now keeps all of these manifests in step with `package.json` on `npm version`. This brings apple-photos-mcp to the same multi-host packaging parity as the other Apple MCP servers (mail, notes, numbers).

### Documentation
- Standardized the `package.json` `description` and GitHub one-liner to the shared house style ("… via Claude and other AI assistants") for consistency across the Apple MCP servers.
- Refreshed the README tagline to reflect the full query/search/export/inspect capabilities, matching the GitHub repo one-liner and `package.json` description.
- Added `docs/NODE-RUNTIME-AND-TCC-PERMISSIONS.md`: why macOS re-prompts for Full Disk Access / Automation when the server runs under an ad-hoc-signed (e.g. Homebrew) Node, and the fix — run it under the official Developer-ID-signed Node so the grant survives Node updates. README and CLAUDE.md now point at it.

## [0.3.0] (2026-06-20)

Bulletproof install & updates — the Python sidecar now sets itself up.

### Added

- **Automatic Python venv bootstrap on first use.** If the `osxphotos` venv is missing or out of date, the first tool call now creates the venv and installs `osxphotos` automatically (one-time; the first call can take ~a minute, with progress logged to stderr), then proceeds. A fresh install via npm, `npx`, or the Claude Code marketplace now works with **no manual `npm run setup` step** — though running it ahead of time still works as a pre-warm.
- New env vars: `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_NO_AUTO_SETUP` (set truthy to disable the automatic bootstrap and require a manual `npm run setup`) and `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_SETUP_TIMEOUT` (ms cap on the bootstrap, default 5 min).

### Fixed

- **Self-healing interpreter resolution.** The Python interpreter is no longer pinned at startup: a venv created or repaired while the server is running is picked up on the next call, with **no restart required**. (Previously, if the venv didn't exist when the server started, the server cached the system Python and kept reporting the dependency as missing until restarted.)
- **Stale-venv detection.** `scripts/setup.sh` records the `requirements.txt` it installed against (a `venv/.deps-ok` marker); after an update changes requirements, the server detects the mismatch and rebuilds the venv automatically — so **updates are picked up without a manual reinstall**.
- When automatic setup can't run (no Python 3, no `pip`, or offline), tools now return a clear, actionable error pointing at `npm run setup`.

Maturity release bringing apple-photos-mcp to feature/stability parity with apple-mail-mcp and apple-notes-mcp.

### Added

- **`doctor` tool** — a richer diagnostic than `health-check`: checks the osxphotos install, Photos library readability, and Full Disk Access separately, each reported as ok / warn / fail with actionable advice (`structuredContent` carries the raw `{ healthy, checks[] }`). Reach for it when a tool returns a permission or "unable to open" error — it pinpoints which requirement is missing.
- **`structuredContent` on every read tool** — `health-check`, `library-info`, `query`, `get-photo`, `list-albums`, `list-folders`, `list-keywords`, `list-persons`, and `export` now return typed JSON alongside the human-readable text, so agents can consume results without parsing prose.
- **MCP resources & prompts** — resources `photos://library`, `photos://albums`, `photos://persons`, `photos://keywords`, and the templated `photos://photo/{uuid}`; prompts `find-photos`, `export-photos`, and `photo-summary`.
- **File-based config loader** — reads `~/Library/Application Support/apple-photos-mcp/config.json` (override via `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_CONFIG_FILE`), merging string values into the environment without overriding already-set vars, so settings survive a host that strips the MCP env block.
- **Integration test suite** — `test/integration.test.ts` (+ `vitest.integration.config.ts`, `npm run test:integration` / `test:all`) drives the real osxphotos → Photos library stack read-only; the live tests self-skip when no library is available, so it is safe on CI. A new `integration` CI job runs it on macOS.
- **Docs** — `docs/FULL-DISK-ACCESS.md` (why Full Disk Access is required and how to grant/verify it) and `docs/LIMITATIONS.md` (read-only scope, iCloud-export caveats, face/album behavior, library lag), plus a `CLAUDE.md` agent guide.

### Changed

- **Hardened the Python bridge** — the subprocess `maxBuffer` (100 MB default) is now overridable via `APPLE_PHOTOS_MCP_MAX_BUFFER` for very large libraries.
- **CI** now runs `format:check` and tests with coverage (per-directory thresholds), and a separate macOS `integration` job.
- **Plugin version sync** — `scripts/sync-plugin-version.mjs` keeps both `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` in step with `package.json` on `npm version` (the marketplace manifest had drifted to 0.1.0).
- Test suite grown from 17 to 57 unit tests plus 9 integration tests.

### Fixed

- **Plugin install no longer blocked by husky** — `prepare` changed from `husky && npm run build` to `husky; npm run build`, so the build still runs when husky can't initialize (e.g. a marketplace git-clone install).
- **Decoupled plugin vs project-scope MCP entrypoint resolution.** The root `.mcp.json` uses `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/build/index.js` for the clone/contributor workflow, and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` declares its own `mcpServers` using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/build/index.js` for marketplace plugin installs. Previously the bare relative path `build/index.js` failed in both contexts. Because `plugin.json` now declares `mcpServers`, the plugin no longer auto-loads the root `.mcp.json`, avoiding double-registration. Mirrors the fix in apple-mail-mcp.

## 0.1.3 (2026-05-01)

- **feat(export):** automatic iCloud download fallback. When an original isn't on disk, the export now retries via Photos.app/AppleScript (`use_photos_export=True`) — same behavior as opening the photo in Photos, which downloads it on demand. Previously these photos were always skipped with "original not downloaded from iCloud" even when the user had iCloud connectivity.
- Subprocess timeout for `export` raised from 5 minutes to 30 minutes to accommodate large iCloud download batches.
- Skip reason on the unrecoverable case now reads `"original not downloaded from iCloud (download attempt returned no files)"` so it's distinguishable from the no-attempt skip.

## 0.1.1 (2026-04-30)

- **fix(query):** parse `fromDate` / `toDate` as ISO 8601 datetimes — osxphotos requires real `datetime` objects, not strings, so date filters previously crashed with an opaque "Command failed" error.
- **fix(export):** when osxphotos returns no files because the original isn't downloaded from iCloud, surface that as a `skipped` entry with reason "original not downloaded from iCloud" instead of silently reporting `0 exported / 0 skipped`.
- **fix(python bridge):** when the Python sidecar crashes with a traceback, return the stderr output instead of the bare Node "Command failed: …" message — much easier to debug.
- Tests: covered date forwarding, missing-photo skip, and all five `runPhotosReader` error paths (8 → 16 tests).

## 0.1.0 (2026-04-30)

Initial release.

- TypeScript MCP server with a Python sidecar based on [osxphotos](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos).
- Tools: `health-check`, `library-info`, `query`, `get-photo`, `list-albums`, `list-folders`, `list-keywords`, `list-persons`, `export`.
- `query` filters: album, keyword, person, date range, favorite/hidden flags, photo/movie type, title/description substring, and limit.
- `export` supports originals, edited versions, raw, live-photo videos, and overwrite.
